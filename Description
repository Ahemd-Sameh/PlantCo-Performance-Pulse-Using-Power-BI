Project Description:
The Plant Co.  Performance Dashboard 2023 is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide comprehensive 
insights into the quantity, sales, and gross profit performance of Plant Company for the year 2023. This dashboard 
visualizes key metrics such as year-to-date (YTD) quantity, sales, gross profit percentage (GP%), and monthly performance 
comparisons. It helps stakeholders understand the company's performance across different countries and product types, 
enabling informed decision-making.

figures, gross profit, and product types.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in data 
formatting using Excel for initial preparation.

Data Import to Power BI:
Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI for further analysis and visualization.
Data Modeling:
Created relationships between different tables in the dataset to enable accurate and efficient data analysis.
Ensured the data model supports the necessary calculations and visualizations.
Dashboard Design:
Layout Planning: Designed the layout of the dashboard, ensuring a logical flow and easy navigation for users.
Visual Elements: Added various visualizations to represent the performance data:
Tree Map: Bottom 10 YTD vs PYTD by country, showing the countries with the most significant changes.
Waterfall Chart: Quantity YTD vs PYTD by month, country, and product, visualizing increases and decreases in quantities sold.
KPI Cards: Key performance indicators showing YTD quantity, YTD vs PYTD change, PYTD, and GP%.
Clustered Column Chart: Quantity YTD & PYTD by month, displaying product type distribution (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor) and PYTD values.
Scatter Plot: Account profitability segmentation, showing GP% and quantity correlation.

Interactive Elements:
Filters and Slicers: Implemented slicers to allow users to filter data by year, product type, and country, providing a 
customized view of the data.
Dynamic Charts: Ensured that charts and graphs update dynamically based on user selections from filters and slicers.

Final Touches:
Aesthetic Enhancements: Applied a consistent color scheme, fonts, and design elements to enhance the visual appeal of 
the dashboard.
Usability Testing: Conducted usability testing to ensure the dashboard is intuitive and user-friendly, making adjustments 
based on feedback.

Technical Details:
Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Cleaning: Utilized Excel for initial data cleaning and preparation.
Design Considerations: Focused on creating an accessible and visually appealing interface, with a clear emphasis on ease 
of use and readability.
